# Stack overflow

```
function something() {
    something()
}

something()
```

If you debug that function, you see that the 'call stack' fills up.
Each function call pushes allocated memory space in the call stack.
When there's no more space, it's stack overflow.

It happens if the recursive function has no way to exit and stop, eventually.
