# Breadth First Search

Data is traversed 'horizontally'.
First we read the root node, then all the nodes on level 2, then all the nodes on level 3...

BFS takes memory, because we need to track the children of all the nodes on a given level.

     9
  4     20
1  6   15  170

BFS [9, 4, 20, 1, 6, 15, 170]

It's very good for:
- finding shortest path
- working with closer nodes could be useful

Downside: memory occupation
