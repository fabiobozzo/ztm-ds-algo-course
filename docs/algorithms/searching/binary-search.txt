# Binary Search

... If the data in the list is sorted, is that an advantage?

Yes! we could visit half the item of the list!

Like the good old phone book searching.

We pick the index in the middle of the list and ask ourself:
is the number we're looking for bigger or smaller than the item at the current index?
if bigger, we discard the part of the list at the left of the index, and vice-versa.

Sometimes looking for an element is called traversal.
