# Depth First Search

It follows one branch of the tree down to as many levels as possible,
until the target is found or the end is reach,
then continue with the nearest ancestor.

Lower memory requirement than BFS.
It's a vertical approach and looks like going through a maze.

     9
  4     20
1  6   15  170

DFS [9, 4, 1, 6, 20, 15, 170]

Different than BFS, he? But why having 2 ways of traversing trees/charts?

PROs:
- if we know a node is a leaf, it's efficient
- it uses less memory
- good with question: does a path exist?

CONs:
- it can get slow with deep graphs
