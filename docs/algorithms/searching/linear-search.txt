# Linear Search

In CS linear (sequential) search is about finding a target value in a list.

It sequentially check every item of a list until the target item is found or the list is finished.

In worst case, every single node has to be checked, e.g. if the item is not in the list.

Javascript has different methods:

- indexOf
- findIndex
- find
- includes

O(n) is ok... but not the best.
We can't use it to index websites (google) or search for friends (facebook).

If the data in the list is sorted, is that an advantage? ...
