# Graph & Tree Traversal

It's a search basically.
Sometimes we want to do something on traversed nodes.

e.g. if nodes are object, adding new properties.
maybe the tree/graph is not sorted, so we have to visit EVERY node.

two ways (same for graphs and trees):

- breadth first search (/traversal)
- depth first search (/traversal)

time complexity: O(n)
