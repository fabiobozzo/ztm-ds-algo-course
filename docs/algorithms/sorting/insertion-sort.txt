# Insertion sort

Bubble and selection sort are not really efficient nor used.

Insertion sort is not the most efficient, but there's cases where it's actually extremely fast:
when the array is "almost sorted".

- We first loop over the array..
- if the item we're looking for is less than the first item in the array, we move that item in front of the array, and shift it to the right

- otherwise, we must figure out where the item should go;
- another loop and if statement to find the right spot for the number.

Best case scenario (almost sorted input): it's the fastest algorithm. Same with small datasets.
