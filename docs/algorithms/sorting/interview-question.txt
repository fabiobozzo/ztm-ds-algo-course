//#1 - Sort 10 schools around your house by distance:
Insertion sort. (fast on small sort, easy to code, space complexity O(1), data probably somewhat sorted)

//#2 - eBay sorts listings by the current Bid amount:
Radix or Counting sort. Bid is a number in a relatively small range, assuming them to be integers.

//#3 - Sport scores on ESPN
Quick sort. (if it's in memory, better go with a light&fast weapon that doesn't take too much space)

//#4 - Massive database (can't fit all into memory) needs to sort through past year's user data
Merge sort.

//#5 - Almost sorted Udemy review data needs to update and add 2 new reviews
Insertion sort.

//#6 - Temperature Records for the past 50 years in Canada
We could use radix/counting sort in case temperature values have no decimal places.
If decimal places are there, just use quick sort.

//#7 - Large user name database needs to be sorted. Data is very random.
Merge sort (if we have enough memory).
Quick sort (if I'm not too worried about worst case, to save some memory)

//#8 - You want to teach sorting for the first time
BUBBLE SORT! Yay! :)
