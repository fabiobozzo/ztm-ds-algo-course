# The issue with sort()

Don't always trust your language's built-in sort method.
Javascript has a shitty one. It converts numbers to strings. -_-
A similar example is Italian letters (strings starting with an accent)
sort() uses the lexicographical order (.charCodeAt()) -> ascii index used to compare.
