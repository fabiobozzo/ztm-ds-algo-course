# The issue with sort()

Don't always trust your language's built-in sort method.
Javascript has a shitty one. It converts numbers to strings. -_-
A similar example is Italian letters (strings starting with an accent)
sort() uses the lexicographical order (.charCodeAt()) -> ascii index used to compare.

# Stable sorting

A sorting algorithm is said to be stable if two objects with equal keys appear
in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input array to be sorted.
Some sorting algorithms are stable by nature like Insertion sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort, etc.
And some sorting algorithms are not, like Heap Sort, Quick Sort, etc.

There's a few reasons why stability can be important.
One is that, if two records don't need to be swapped by swapping them you can cause a memory update,
a page is marked dirty, and needs to be re-written to disk (or another slow medium).

It depends on what you do.
Imagine you've got some people records with a first and a last name field.
First you sort the list by first name. If you then sort the list with a stable algorithm by last name,
you'll have a list sorted by first name AND last name.
