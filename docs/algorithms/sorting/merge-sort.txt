# Merge sort

Insertion, bubble and selection sort are the elementary algo.
They have nested for loops: O(n^2). Pretty slow... we can do better.

Here is O(n log(n)):
- Merge sort
- Quick sort

They recall the idea of the phone book search, divide et impera.
They use recursion, dividing each problem down to do work on each subset and then combine the solutions.

How does it work?
- Divide the array in half
- Then divide the subsets in half, again.
- Once we get to an array of 1 element, start merging sub-arrays keeping them sorted
