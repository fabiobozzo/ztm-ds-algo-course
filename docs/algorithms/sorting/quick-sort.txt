# Quick Sort

Fancy name, it's another divide & conquer algorithm. O(n log(n)).

Pivoting technique.

You choose a pivot, a random index in the array.

Then you put it at the end of the array, swapping it.

You loop from the beginning to the end of the array.

If one item is lower than the pivot (now, the last item),
then you move it at the loop's index position.
(that means moving all the lower-than-pivot elements at the beginning of the array).

You move the pivot back in the middle of the list, right after the bigger item lower than itself.

And finally you recursively (quick)sort the array to the left of the pivot and the one on the right.
