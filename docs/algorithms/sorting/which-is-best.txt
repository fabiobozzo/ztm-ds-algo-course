# Which sort is best?

- Insertion sort is easy, uses little space, it's good for almost sorted data, small datasets.

- Bubble sort is rarely used (teaching purposes). Same with selection sort.

- Merge sort is my favorite. O(n log(n)) always, no worst case scenario! At a cost: space complexity is O(n).
But if sorting is on huge datasets and is outside of memory, go for it.

- Quick sort is the most used. Little space complexity, and super fast on average.
The gotcha is the worst case. It could be O(n^2)

- Heap sort?! (similar to quick sort and merge sort,
but with space complexity of O(1),
but on average a bit worse of quick sort)
