# Hash function

Generates a value of fixed length for every input it gets. 
examples: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256...

it's impossible -or very difficult- to reverse hashes (from hash to input string)
changing even the smallest details, completely changes the result hash
but it's idempotent! the same input always generates the same output.

isn't it slow? no :) 
SHA-256 takes a lot of time, it's used for cryptography.

we assume O(1)
