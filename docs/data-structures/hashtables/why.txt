You want quick access to named items.
Sort of a mini database. 
They're also called associative arrays (we choose our own keys).
Insertion is immediate.
But.. order is not guaranteed.

Recap:

HashTables PROs
- fast lookups (if collision resolution is good enough)
- fast inserts
- flexible keys (not just strings)

CONs
- unordered
- slow keys iteration
