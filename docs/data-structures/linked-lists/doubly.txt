# Doubly linked lists

They have two pointers. The usual one to the next node and another one pointing to the PREVIOUS node!

Singly is simple to implement. 
A little bit faster, less ops. 
Downside: cannot be traversed from tail to head.
Fast insertion/deletion, not much searching.

Doubly can be traversed in both senses.
a bit more complex, more storage, a few more ops.
good when you have no limitations of memory, suitable for searches.
