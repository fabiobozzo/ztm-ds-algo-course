# Balanced VS Unbalanced BST

If I keep adding nodes higher of 1, they are all added to the right side, making the tree look more like a linked list.
Unbalanced mean O(n), worst case is looking up every single node. It's bad.

Ideally we want to balance a binary search tree.
That's possible via a complex algorithm, but in general peeps use ready to use language-provided tree.
