# Binary search trees

very common, is a subset of binary trees.
really good at searching, great at comparing things.
they preserve relationships (e.g. fs folder hierarchy)

Data is SORTED.

Rules:
1. all child nodes to the right of the root node must be greater than the current node
2. all child nodes to the left of the root node must be lower than the current node.
3. a node can only have up to two children

worst than array for lookups, better for the rest.
