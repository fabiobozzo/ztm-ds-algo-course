# Trees

Hierarchical (non-linear) structure.
Parent-child unidirectional relationships.
Every child descends only from one parent.
Leaf nodes are the very end of the structure.
Subtrees are important too.

The DOM is a good example of a tree.
The first chess playing algorithms were based on trees.

Linked lists are also trees! Just with one only path.
