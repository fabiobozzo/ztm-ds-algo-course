# O(log n)

Binary trees:

level 0: 2^0 = 1
level 1: 2^1 = 2
level 2: 2^2 = 4
level 3: 2^3 = 8
level 4: 2^4 = 16

number of nodes in a tree: (2^height) -1

log nodes = height

log 100 = 2; 10^2 = 100;

to search something in a binary tree with height = 3, we need only 3 steps (not 7, aka N).

example: search in a phonebook is divide and conquer. 

O(log n) is important because super fast.
