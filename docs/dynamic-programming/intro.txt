# Dynamic Programming

DP is just an optimization technique, the name itself doesn't mean anything.

If you have something that you can cache during execution, then use DP.

Solve problems by breaking them into sub-problems. Solve sub-problems just once and store their solution to be reused,
in case the next time it's needed again.
